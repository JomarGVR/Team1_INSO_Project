     The purpose of OEG is to create a place where users can<br> create proposal projects and people can join and participate in<br> their projects. If you have a big scope idea but require help, you<br> can set a proposal where they haveto show A3 chart and probably a figma representation of your project idea. All parties<br> benefit on FireUp because the contributors can add these projectsto their resumes. It is basically a hackathon that is always ongoing. Companies can check on what projects are in development  on<br> the site and can benefit andrecruit talented users. The purpose of the site is to provide exposure to talented individuals,<br> growth, and teamwork opportunities to grow and develop. Its purpose is to providegrounds to advance in tech and learn from other<br> talented individuals.
